# PurchaseOrderApp

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.3.7.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
npx json-server --watch db.json --port 3000
ng serve
```

To run json-server and Angular development server concurrently, you can use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.
